This project is for the M5StickC Plus.
It's a watch face with date/time & battery display.
It connects to the NIST database through local WiFi for accurate date/time.
It uses the internal gyroscope and accelerometer to dim and illuminate the screen as it's brought up for viewing.
Battery conservation is a priority with this program.

As a secondary function I've added control for a WiZ lighting system using either the standard buttons or a 2 button extension from M5.

I've also implemented a screen for debugging.
